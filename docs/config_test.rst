.. _config_test:

Configuration: test
-------------------

Metadata about each test is stored in a JSON configuration file. See :ref:`basic_usage` for an example of the syntax.

The following fields can be used to describe a single test.



Mandatory fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**name** *[string]*
    Name of the test.
**version** *[string]*
    Version of the test.
**args** *[list of strings]*
    A list of command-line arguments that will be passed to the software under test.



Optional fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**description** *[string]*
    A short description to help identification of this version.
**minimum_app_version** *[string]*
    The minimum software version required for the test to be executed (see :ref:`config_sw`). If the software under test does not satisfy this requirement, then the test is removed from the test suite before execution. This allows you to run the latest test suite on old software without test failures.
**input_files** *[list of strings]*
    A list of required input files. Each path is specified relative to the location of the configuration file itself.
**output_files** *[dict of string-string pairs]*
    A list of expected output files. The key is a path to the output file, relative to the working directory when the test is run. The value identifies the file type, which determines how it shall be compared to a benchmark (see :ref:`compare`).
**fail_strings** *[list of strings]*
    If any of these strings are found in the stdout or stderr streams, the test is considered failed.
